			I am a PhD student at the University of Bath under the supervision of <a href = "https://people.bath.ac.uk/xs214/"> Xiuping Su</a>. Our research is centred around cluster algebras on Grassmannians and their quantum counterparts. In fact any bit of maths containing the word Grassmannian is probably of great interest to me. The two main things I'm thinking about at the moment are quantum cluster characters for Grassmannians as 			well as interesting questions about quiver Grassmannians. Once I have some papers to display I will add a section for these below.

				Teaching
			</h2>			

			<p2>

			In any given semester I will be tutoring either the first or second year algebra module in some various combinations. These modules are <a href = "https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2020-2021/ma/MA10209.html"> Algebra 1A</a>, <a href = "https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2018-2019/ma/MA10210.html"> Algebra 1B</a>, <a href = "https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2012-2013/ma/MA20216.htm"> Algebra 2A</a> and <a href = "https://			www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2021-2022/ma/MA20217.html"> Algebra 2B</a>.

			<h2>
				Conferences and organisation
			</h2>
			

			<p2>
			<ul class = "a">
				<li>I am currently the organiser for the PhD Algebra, Geometry and Number theory seminar at Bath. When we actually have something to talk about we meet to discuss topics usually based around one persons talk descending into a large discussion. (Not to be confused with the "grown-up" <a href = "https://people.bath.ac.uk/masadk/seminar/geom/">Algebra, Geometry and Number theory seminar at Bath</a>) </li>

			
			<li>I am also co-organiser of the LMS graduate meeting on representation theory in Bath in January. Once a webpage is up I will link it here. If you are a early career mathematician (whatever that actually means) and			    would like to give a talk feel free to email me at the address at the top of the page. </li>

			<li>I was in Aarhus, Denmark helping my supervisor Xiuping Su teach the exercise classes during the Masterclass conference <a href = "https://conferences.au.dk/categoriesclusterscompletions2023"> Categories, clusters and completions</a> (22/03 - 24/03). </li>


			</p2>

			<li>
				I will be at a conference in Kent <a href = "https://www.kent.ac.uk/smsas/personal/sl261/Conference/Canterbury2023/SpringSchoolARTKent2023.html"> spring school Representation theory in Canterbury </a> from (24/04 - 28/04).
