			I am a PhD student at the University of Bath under the supervision of <a href = "https://people.bath.ac.uk/xs214/"> Xiuping Su</a>. My research is centred around cluster algebras on Grassmannians, their quantum counterparts and the role of quiver Grassmannians in this picture. In fact any bit of maths containing the word Grassmannian is probably of great interest to me. Once I have some papers to display I will add a section for these below.

				Teaching

			In previous semesters I tutored either the first or second year algebra module in some various combinations. These modules are <a href = "https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2020-2021/ma/MA10209.html"> Algebra 1A</a>, <a href = "https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2018-2019/ma/MA10210.html"> Algebra 1B</a>, <a href = "https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2012-2013/ma/MA20216.htm"> Algebra 2A</a> and <a href = "https://			www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2021-2022/ma/MA20217.html"> Algebra 2B</a>. I am now tutoring <a href = 'https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2022-2023/cm/CM30173.html'> Cryptography</a>. For my cryptography students, here is the link to the <a href = "https://github.com/LiRiordan/CM30173"> code/notes</a> from our tutorials. These will probably contain errors but could be helpful for you to look back over. I will try to update before each tutorial but given I often write them the evening before this may not always be true.

			<li>I was in Aarhus, Denmark helping my supervisor Xiuping Su teach the exercise classes during the Masterclass conference <a href = "https://conferences.au.dk/categoriesclusterscompletions2023"> Categories, clusters and completions</a> (22/03 - 24/03). </li>

			<li> I was at CIRM (27/11/23-01/12/23) for the conference on <a href = "https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2875.html"> Current trends in representation theory, cluster algebras and geometry</a>.
			</li>

			<li> During 17-19 January I co-organised the graduate meeting for an <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/lms-regional-meeting-2023-sout?usp=sharing"> LMS conference</a>.
